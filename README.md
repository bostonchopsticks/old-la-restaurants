LA Historic Restaurants
========================

LALALA food is good, so are crazy old restaurants! yum!

Why do all our map projects relate to food? Are we really hungry? Is it snacktime yet?

# Project ideas
- Make an extra-fun food-themed old-fashioned `Mapbox Studio` layer
- Add photos from LA Public Library `Live and Dine in LA` old archived menu exhibit
- Add historic photographs of the restaurants
- Categorize restaurants by whether they are open now or not
