[Check out the `.geojson` so far.]((https://github.com/maptimeLA/old-la-restaurants/blob/master/data/historic_restaurants.geojson))

Why do all our map projects relate to food? Are we really hungry? Is it snacktime yet?

# What we have so far:
- [x] Restaurant name, address, year data sorted, formatted and cleaned
- [x] Addresses properly formatted
- [x] Addresses geocoded
- [x] [Preliminary `.geojson` map](https://github.com/maptimeLA/old-la-restaurants/blob/master/data/historic_restaurants.geojson)
- [ ] Styling
- [ ] Data bubbles formatting
- [ ] Data pin customizing
- [ ] Add images, menus, links


# Project ideas
- Make an extra-fun food-themed old-fashioned `Mapbox Studio` layer
- Add photos from LA Public Library `Live and Dine in LA` old archived menu exhibit
- Add historic photographs of the restaurants
- Categorize restaurants by whether they are open now or not
